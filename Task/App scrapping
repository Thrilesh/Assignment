Install the app on your mobile device: Before you can extract data from the app, you need to install it on your mobile device. You can download the app from the App Store or Google Play Store, depending on the operating system of your device.
Identify the data you want to extract: Once you have installed the app, you need to identify the data that you want to extract. In the case of Milkbasket or SuprDaily, you may want to extract data such as product name, price, quantity, description, image, etc.
Use a screen recording tool: To extract data from the app, you can use a screen recording tool that can record your screen activity as you navigate through the app.
Record your screen while navigating the app: Once you have installed the screen recording tool, you can start recording your screen while navigating the app. Make sure to record all the screens that contain the data you want to extract.
Extract data from the recorded video: After you have recorded the screen activity, you can use video editing software such as Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro to extract data from the recorded video. These tools allow you to trim and cut the video, and also enable you to export the video frames as images.
Use image recognition tools: Once you have exported the frames as images, you can use image recognition tools such as Google Cloud Vision or AWS Recognition to extract data from the images. These tools use machine learning algorithms to recognize text and objects in the images and can extract data such as product names, prices, etc.
Clean and organize the data: Once you have extracted the data from the images, you may need to clean and organize the data to make it usable. You can use tools such as OpenRefine or Excel to clean and organize the data and export it to a format such as CSV or JSON.
Analyze and visualize the data: After you have extracted and cleaned the data, you can analyze it to gain insights and visualize it using tools such as Tableau or Power BI. These tools allow you to create interactive dashboards and visualizations that can help you understand the data better.
